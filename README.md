# orbital_the_box
These are scripts for calculating incoming irradiance, converting solar longitude to day (and vice versa) by solving the Kepler equation, calculating orbital speed, etc. These scripts were used to create the orbit and irradiance distribution plots for the "Orbital, the Box" web browser based teaching tool: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4597618

If you use these scripts, please consider citing https://eartharxiv.org/repository/view/2229/, as well as the stuff cited in the documentation of the functions.
